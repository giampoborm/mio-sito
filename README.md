# Fare Niente Production

This project is a simple site built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It uses a small router and dynamic modules to load each page.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The site will be served on <http://localhost:5173> by default.

## Building for Production

Run the following to generate the `dist` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Use `npm run preview` to test the production build locally.

## Running Tests

Unit tests use Node's built-in test runner. Execute:

```bash
npm test
```
